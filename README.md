# Welcome!

Howdy folks!
<br>
This is my personal repo for a project done @ Trybe. <br> It was the first project that actually wrote some back-end code, with NodeJS and ExpressJS.
<br>
The objective of this project was to solidify my knowledge of Node and Express, routing and HTTP actions.
<br>
I added line 5, and line 22 onwards.
<br>
If you'd like to get in touch, just to say hi or to ask something about the project, feel free to send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/otavio-cantareli/).
